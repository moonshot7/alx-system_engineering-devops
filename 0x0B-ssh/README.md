# 0x0B SSH :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers the SSH implementation and management for real enviroment scenarios

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What is a server
* Where servers usually live
* What is SSH
* How to create an SSH RSA key pair
* How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
* The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash


## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.
1. Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
2. SSH client configuration
3. Puppet client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.
